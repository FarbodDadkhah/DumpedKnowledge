💡 App Idea: “Personal Research Companion”

A tool where users can save articles, papers, and bookmarks, then later ask questions or get summaries from their personal knowledge base.

🔧 How the Stack Fits

Next.js (frontend)

Chrome extension or web app to quickly save links/snippets.

Dashboard to browse saved items & ask questions.

Auth handled via Supabase.

FastAPI (backend)

Fetches webpage content or PDF text.

Cleans, chunks, and embeds the text.

Handles Q&A requests with retrieval from ChromaDB.

ChromaDB (vector store)

Stores semantic embeddings of articles/papers.

Enables contextual Q&A: “What were the main arguments in that climate paper?”

Supabase (database)

Stores structured metadata: titles, authors, URLs, timestamps, tags.

Handles user accounts, bookmarks, and preferences.

✨ Features

Save Anything

Save a link or upload a PDF → metadata in Supabase, embeddings in ChromaDB.

Organize & Tag

Add custom tags (e.g., “AI research”, “health”).

Full-text + semantic search combined.

Ask & Retrieve

“What are the latest methods in reinforcement learning I saved?”

Backend retrieves context, returns structured answer + references.

Summaries

Option to generate TL;DRs of saved articles.

📱 Example Use Case

A PhD student saves all relevant research papers.

During thesis writing, they ask: “Which papers talk about ethical risks in AI systems?” → The system pulls a semantic answer from their collection.
